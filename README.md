I have included all of the code for my project. The project report is the pdf file.
There are two traces, trace.txt is the small custom trace that was asked for,
however I have the trace for all the large datasets included too (used for demos).

To run the program:
	There is a makefile which will compile everything. My program uses command line
	arguments so include the text file of data. (ie: ./a.out small.txt)
